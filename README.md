Chatlite
========

Toy chat written in C, no real motivation, just enjoying some simple and 
~no-nonsense~ too late, code.

- TCP based text protocol (currently no checks on the input)
- I/O Multiplexing, using EPOLL, maybe extend support to Mac OSX through Kqueue
- Feature set (most are not implemented yet)
    - Nicknames
    - Rooms / Channels
    - Direct messaging, friend list
    - Auth token
    - Basic antispam / ban system
    - Utility commands, reminders
    - Proper client with a decent communication protocol
